The Open Jef

There's 1 excluded folder, that being /Vods It's excluded due to being 1.5TB large, and not important for editing yet.
We can work on making something there when i figure out how to ignore all of jpg/exe/bat/mp4/avi and other video formats from the sub folders there
There's also a custom directory browser inn that folder that is written by me that can be replaced by something better when the time comes.
